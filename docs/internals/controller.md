# The controller

The Thunderbird console has a controller with 8 buttons, because this fits into 1 byte (8bits).

## The buttons

There are 8 buttons on the controller: A, B, Left, Right, Up, Down, Left trigger (LB) and Right trigger (RB).

## Pressed buttons

The buttons pressed by the controller are stored in the first byte of memory.
See [getting pressed keys in the queue section](/queue#getting-pressed-keys).
